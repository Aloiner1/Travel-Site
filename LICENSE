# Ye Olde Meme License (Totally Not Serious Edition)

**Copyright (c) 2025 Wonder Tour, the Chillest Travel Crew on the Interwebs**

Yo, listen up, homie! You’ve stumbled upon the sacred code of the *Travel-Site*, a masterpiece forged in the fires of VS Code and fueled by coffee and memes. By the power of the Great Cat Meme, we hereby grant you, the Epic Coder or Random Internet Wanderer, permission to vibe with this software like it’s a Friday night Discord party. 🐱‍💻

## You Can:
- **Use** this code to make your own dope travel site or just flex it for clout.
- **Copy** it like it’s your grandma’s secret cookie recipe.
- **Modify** it to add more *a e s t h e t i c* or Rickroll links (we won’t judge).
- **Merge** it with other projects, like a DJ remixing a banger.
- **Publish** it to show the world you’re a coding wizard.
- **Sublicense** it, because sharing is caring.
- **Sell** it, if you find someone who pays for *free* code (good luck, champ).
- **Yeet** it to anyone else, as long as they follow these sacred rules.

## You Gotta:
- Keep this **copyright notice** and the permission text in all copies, or we’ll haunt you with Comic Sans.
- Not blame us if your app crashes harder than a Windows 95 PC. 😹

## The Fine Print (aka Boring Legal Stuff):
This software is provided "AS IS," like a meme you found on X at 3 AM. We ain’t promising it’ll make you rich, get you a date, or even work without bugs. If this code yeets your server into the void or makes your cat uninstall your IDE, don’t come crying to us. We’re not liable for any *OOF* moments, whether in contract, tort, or any other legal drama.

**TL;DR**: Take this code, have fun, don’t sue us, and maybe drop a meme in the comments. 🤙

*Signed,*
